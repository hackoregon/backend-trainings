## What is Hack Oregon?

[Hack Oregon](http://www.hackoregon.org/) is a rapid prototyping lab taking a creative approach to
data projects that bring insight to complex issues in the public
interest. Weâ€™re a community-powered nonprofit, our teams are made of
volunteers, and all the work we do is open source.
